* OLD HISTORY

I used to keep Change Log sections in my files, but with git (and especially
Magit), this practice is increasingly dated.

So At this point (after Tag 0.200) I will now only maintain the DVCS log. Also
I'm removing the Change Log section from all the files that have one, and
keeping that history here (however incomplete it is).

NO FURTHER CHANGES TO HISTORY.org ARE PLANNED (except for corrections). It's
just for recording the old history of my Emacs configuration as it made its way
into Spacemacs.

** init.el

;;              - moved mu4e config out to a `required' feature file
;;              - load the PHP layer, but without the `php-extras' package,

;;  MJL20160107 - added xkcd layer
;;  MJL20160111 - turned off display-time-mode because it doesn't always appear,

;;  MJL20160210 - require the mu4e config for work systems, rather than test

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;  MJL20151220 - Created, copied from osx layer, then imported much from my own
;;                ~/.emacs.d/mjl/boot/bindings.el
;;  MJL20151222 - Added rest of Sun keys and my F-keys
;;  MJL20160102 - bind font scaling to C-+/- as well (easy to type, doesn't
;;                break much)
;;  MJL20160104 - Swap F2 and F3 to better match physical key labels
;;              - bind font scaling to s-\ and s-] as well (these are in roughly
;;                traditional places on the TEK 209)
;;  MJL20160111 - bind `helm-M-x' to the <menu>/<apps> key, it's better, now I
;;                know how to use it.
;;              - map s-f, s-r, <next> and <prior> within isearch-mode-map
;;              - remove C-z binding: it causes more trouble than it's worth
;;  MJL20160118 - C-z and C-v: make them modern bindings: I don't use the defaults
;;  MJL20160203 - Emacs metadata
;;  MJL20160206 - variables control whether to bind key groupings
;;              - take out the Mac meta/option/super stuff -- osx layer can better
;;                handle this, and now I'm not conflicting the bindings
;;  MJL20160316 - (temporary hack) `wdired-change-to-wdired-mode' binding
;;  MJL20160318 - binding for helm-M-x on my TEK229/PC mode, plugged into a Mac Air
;;  MJL20160319 - M-n and M-p for paging with a Mac
;;  MJL20160420 - binding for helm-M-x on my TEK229/PC mode, plugged into a Mac Pro

;;  MJL20160808 - Bind <home> and <end> to whatever C-a and C-e are bound to

;;  MJL20160911 - super-shift-S Save-As
;;              - super-shift-O Open directory
;;  MJL20161014 - window split bindings like my iTerm2
;;  MJL20161104 - different <menu>-keys bound to M-x, for different OS
;;  MJL20170109 - Use super up/dn for paging up/down on a Mac (same as native)
;;  MJL20170201 - Bind the super-UP/DOWN if we're NOT binding OSX keys
;;                ourselves (because we're relying on the `osx' layer to do Mac
;;                keys, but that layer doesn't include extras)
;;              - `spacemacs/set-leader-keys' for date stamps (od*)
;;              - `spacemacs/set-leader-keys' for toggling Ruler
;;                (tR, which is not reserved, but available and sensible...)
;;              - `spacemacs/set-leader-keys' for `mjl/ui-toggle-gui' (Tu)
;;  MJL20170215 - `spacemacs/set-leader-keys' for `mjl/insert-timestamp-org' (odo)
