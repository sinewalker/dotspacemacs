Personal Spacemacs DEVELOP configuration
====

This is my [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) configuration (see [Spacemacs on Github](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)
).

On this branch, I track updates on the "bleeding edge" Spacemacs [development branch](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop). The purpose of my dotspacemacs *develop* branch is for **adding and using new Spacemacs features which I don't want to wait until they make it to the master release**.

Ideally I would like to work with Spacemacs *master* where practical, and this branch should get merged to dotspacemacs *master* whenever Spacemacs releases a new version.

Most of my goals for my dotspacemacs project have been met, and I'm now just continuing to tweak/update/fix little things.  I'm [still blogging about it](http://milosophical.me/tags/spacemacs.html), occasionally, and still learning.
