* Description

Spacemacs is not just emacs+vim. It can have modern keybindings too! This layer
globally defines common OSX/GUI keybindings, as well as making use of the
extended function and edit keys on a [[http://deskthority.net/wiki/Sun_Type_6][Sun Type 6]] keyboard.

It also includes Mike's personal Emacs functions from over 15 years of
customising emacs.

* Philosophy

While this layer enables common GUI-style bindings, it does not implement OSX
navigation keybindings. Spacemacs is meant to be used with evil and helm.

The layer should work stand-alone without other layers. Any non-standard
functions which are bound to global keys must be defined in this layer, or in
packages which this layer installs (for instance this precludes putting
keybindings for application modes such as dired-ex, which should be done in a
layer that installs and configures that package, and related packages).

This layer was based on the Spacemacs built-in layer =osx= and copies that
layer's functionality. As of early 2016 it has not been tested together with
that layer and will probably clash. I should use this layer in preference to
=osx=, even on a Mac. =osx= also switches to use gls instead of ls in dired.

* Install

** Layer

To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(mjl))
#+END_SRC

*** Use with non-US keyboard layouts

If you need the ~⌥~ key to type common characters such as `{[]}~` which is usual
for e.g. Finnish and Swedish keyboard layouts, you'll probably want to leave the
~⌥~ key unchanged by setting the =mjl-use-option-as-meta= variable to =nil=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
     (mjl :variables mjl-use-option-as-meta nil)))
#+END_SRC

** Mac OS X GNU Coreutils

To get =gls= install coreutils homebrew:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install coreutils
#+END_SRC

* Key Bindings

(Super is denoted by ~⌘~ in the table below, though the actual modifier key to
hold will be dependant on the operating system, and the value of
=mjl-use-option-as-meta= on a Mac)

| Key Binding | Description       |
|-------------+-------------------|
| ~⌘ +~       | Scale up text     |
| ~⌘ -~       | Scale down text   |
| ~⌘ q~       | Quit              |
| ~⌘ v~       | Paste             |
| ~⌘ c~       | Copy              |
| ~⌘ x~       | Cut               |
| ~⌘ a~       | Select all        |
| ~⌘ w~       | Close window      |
| ~⌘ W~       | Close frame       |
| ~⌘ n~       | New frame         |
| ~⌘ z~       | Undo              |
| ~⌘ Z~       | Redo              |
| ~Ctrl ⌘ f~  | Toggle fullscreen |

* Future Work (TODO)

- Install and configure [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/xmsi-math-symbols-input.html][xah-math-input]] minor mode
- explore the use of emacs abbrev for inserting common symbols
- explore a modifier layer for common repeat-symbols
- review the F-key bindings some more
- finish documentation for this =mjl= layer (keybindings list).
