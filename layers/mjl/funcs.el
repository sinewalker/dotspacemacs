;;; Commentary:
;;
;;      Personal emacs utility functions.
;;
;;      The functions in this file date from 2000. There have been changes over
;;      many years, but some of these are still integral to my personal
;;      workflow.

;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;;  This file contains custom utility functions that have been carried over
;;  from ages past. At various times the init file has been renamed. A rough
;;  chronology of these changes is:
;;
;;    2000: ~/.emacsrc
;;    2003: ~/.emacs.el
;;    2008: ~/.emacs.d/init.el
;;    2009: ~/.emacs.d/defuns.el
;;    2011: ~/.emacs.d/mjl/defuns.el
;;    2015: ~/.spacemacs.d/layers/mjl/funcs.el
;;
;;  What follows is the change log for all this history, minus items that have
;;  been removed/relocated/deprecated by advances in Emacs itself, or by
;;  Spacemacs' configurations (particularly UI and also loading mechanics)

The first fix is to use Cygwin/bash under Windows. It assumes
Cygwin is installed and that bash is in the system %PATH%.

The second fix is for an issue with the default GNU pager less,
which doesn't support running in an Emacs buffer. Because pagers
are redundant in an Emacs buffer anyway, the PAGER environment
variable is set to /usr/bin/cat, so that multi-page
output (e.g. from the man command) is dumped directly to the
buffer. You can use Emacs' cursor movement commands to review the
output once it is completed.

The third fix is for the EDITOR variable, to load the file using
emacsclient so that it's edited in emacs. Also the edit alias is
set to the same value."
