;;  PURPOSE:    Keybindings for my personal layer "mjl"
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Using the `osx' layer from Spacemacs as a starting point, this sets global
;;    keybindings for the Super key (which SHOULD NOT be clobbered by emacs
;;    modes). Also including bindings for special keys from the Sun Type 6, and
;;    some f-key bindings (though I'm still debating if these belong in this
;;    layer, or under special configs for specific Emacs applications)
;;
;;    So there are 3 global keymap groupings here:
;;
;;      - Modern/Common bindings, on Super-shifted keys (e.g. Cut/Copy/Paste)
;;      - Function Keys F1-F12 for my personal high-use functions/commands
;;      - Sun Keys Help, Attn/Open/Undo etc to make use of my Type 6
;;
;;    All have been designed so as not to conflict with Spacemacs or Emacs
;;    bindings. Some keys might be masked by the operating system.
;;
;;  HISTORY
;;
;;  Oh boy. My own bindings.el is a tail of woe and fail dating back to 20000807
;;  when I first wanted something simple like PC-style editing keys for
;;  cut/copy/paste. Little did I know back then how much wonder and pain I was
;;  in for. There were hooks and tricks and other pieces of cruft which I don't
;;  think warrant including into this Layer's configuration.
;;
;;  Then, in 2014 when I did my major emacs config overhaul, I looked at my
;;  global bindings with a view to make sense of them, especially for the
;;  F-keys, but also in light of all the munging that ergoemacs did to the
;;  control keys. It was a major mess again (in code, as well as the bindings
;;  themselves).
;;
;;  Part of my motivation to move to Spacemacs in late 2015/early 2016 was to
;;  ditch ergoemacs and return to some sort of sanity in the code, while still
;;  having the global bindings I want, with an opportunity for "modern"-style
;;  keys bound on the Super modifier.
;;
;;  For this layer, I'm adopting the philosophy that I will go with Spacemacs'
;;  use of Helm for many things, and just use global key-bindings for the
;;  "basic" editing functions that I know and love, plus Function Keys (being
;;  the F-keys on the top of most keyboards, as well as the special keys on some
;;  keyboards, like the Sun Type 6). All global settings should work for a
;;  "vanilla" Spacemacs other than functions defined in this layer.
;;
;;
;;  BUGS
;;
;;  MJL20160104 - The "vanilla" rule is broken for some of my old personal
;;  "tools.el" functions, which I've not yet imported into this layer.
;;
;;  MJL20160104 - The date functions which I bound to F11 might work better with
;;  a leader key, rather than modifiers to F11. Jury is still out: I've been
;;  using F11 for date stamps since 2003...

;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;;  MJL20151220 - Created, copied from osx layer, then imported much from my own
;;                ~/.emacs.d/mjl/boot/bindings.el
;;  MJL20151222 - Added rest of Sun keys and my F-keys
;;  MJL20160102 - bind font scaling to C-+/- as well (easy to type, doesn't
;;                break much)
;;  MJL20160104 - Swap F2 and F3 to better match physical key labels
;;              - bind font scaling to s-\ and s-] as well (these are in roughly
;;                traditional places on the TEK 209)
;;  MJL20160111 - bind `helm-M-x' to the <menu>/<apps> key, it's better, now I
;;                know how to use it.
;;              - map s-f, s-r, <next> and <prior> within isearch-mode-map
;;              - remove C-z binding: it causes more trouble than it's worth
;;  MJL20160118 - C-z and C-v: make them modern bindings: I don't use the defaults
;;  MJL20160203 - Emacs metadata
;;  MJL20160206 - variables control whether to bind key groupings
;;              - take out the Mac meta/option/super stuff -- osx layer can better
;;                handle this, and now I'm not conflicting the bindings
;;  MJL20160316 - (temporary hack) `wdired-change-to-wdired-mode' binding
;;  MJL20160318 - binding for helm-M-x on my TEK229/PC mode, plugged into a Mac Air
;;  MJL20160319 - M-n and M-p for paging with a Mac
;;  MJL20160420 - binding for helm-M-x on my TEK229/PC mode, plugged into a Mac Pro
;;  MJL20160729 - bind org-toggle-checkbox in Markdown mode too, since it works.
;;  MJL20160808 - Bind <home> and <end> to whatever C-a and C-e are bound to
;;                (heh, almost exactly 16 years later, still fixing home/end)
;;  MJL20160911 - super-shift-S Save-As
;;              - super-shift-O Open directory
;;  MJL20161014 - window split bindings like my iTerm2
;;  MJL20161104 - different <menu>-keys bound to M-x, for different OS
;;  MJL20170109 - Use super up/dn for paging up/down on a Mac (same as native)
;;  MJL20170201 - Bind the super-UP/DOWN if we're NOT binding OSX keys
;;                ourselves (because we're relying on the `osx' layer to do Mac
;;                keys, but that layer doesn't include extras)
