;;  PURPOSE:    Keybindings for my personal layer "mjl"
;;
;;      Using the `osx' layer from Spacemacs as a starting point, this sets
;;      global keybindings for the Super key (which SHOULD NOT be clobbered by
;;      emacs modes). Also including bindings for special keys from the Sun Type
;;      6, and some f-key bindings (though I'm still debating if these belong in
;;      this layer, or under special configs for specific Emacs applications)
;;
;;  HISTORY
;;
;;  Oh boy. My own bindings.el is a tail of woe and fail dating back to
;;  20000807 when I first wanted something simple like PC-style editing keys for
;;  cut/copy/paste. Little did I know back then how much wonder and pain I was
;;  in for. There were hooks and tricks and other pieces of cruft which I don't
;;  think warrant including into this Layer's configuration.
;;
;;  For this layer, I'm adopting the philosophy that I will go with Spacemacs'
;;  use of Helm for many things, and just use global key-binding for the "basic"
;;  editing functions we all know and love, plus Function Keys (being the F-keys
;;  on the top of most keyboards, as well as the special keys on some keyboards,
;;  like the Sun Type 6). All global settings should work for a "vanilla"
;;

;;  MJL20151220 - Created, copied from osx layer, then imported much from my own
