* Description
This layer configures org mode on top of what is included in the built-in layer
=org=. You should also enable the =org= layer, which is a great general base to
start from but doesn't set or impose any preferences. That's what this layer
does.

  - Personal preferences (this layer is /not/ intended for contribution to
    Spacemacs core)
  - Org Agenda
  - MobileOrg
  - org-gcal sync between Org calendar and Google Calendar
  - calfw to display the calendar nicely

It'd also be nice to sync TODO items with one of the Google tasks tools (either
Tasks, or Keep). But this is low priority because I can use MobileOrg for now to
view, and manually recapture from Keep (Keep is great for capturing late-night
thoughts)

** Philosophy
This layer is for personal preferences only, not to be contributed to Spacemacs
itself. It is shared on a public repository though, so there MUST NOT be any
secrets in it.

While it's specific to me, I want to keep my settings as simple and general as
possible. Any setup or preference that is for certain record types SHOULD be
configured within the individual org files, using =#+STARTUP=, =#+TAGS=,
=#+PROPERTY= or simila (except where it can't, such as faces for tags). So
especially this means the =#+SEQ_TODO= states, which might be different for
Tasks, Projects, Tickets etc.

I also have a thing I want to do to sync/capture Ticket details from work's
ticketing system, but that really belongs in a separate layer so that I only
enable it on work computers.
